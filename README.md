# Star Game

This is star game... it's a game with stars.

So it's pot luck, The game is loaded by running the program and passing a paramiter of under 9900.
This is the number of stars.

`./starGame 1000` will load the game with 1000 stars, this is a good number and makes the game look decent.

Note, entering a paramiter of over 9900 will break the game...

Click on a planet (the greenish dots) then watch over millions of years as stars shoot off.

## END GAME

You end on two stats, either all the stars die and your planet survives or your star dies.
You'll see this when you run the game

## NOTE

This is more a simulation than a game... it isn't particularly fun and more an experement in SDL than anything.

## NOTE

`#define SCALE` is the number you change if you want it to be bigger. it is set to .5 normaly which is good for 1080p displays
